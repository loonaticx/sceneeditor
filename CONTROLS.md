# Enhanced Mouse Navigation

Enhanced mouse navigation is only available when 'Direct Tools' are
enabled. Information on enabling 'Direct Tools' is available in the
`Panda Tools <tools>` section.

Direct Tools gives more functionality to the middle mouse button. First,
clicking the middle mouse button changes the pivot point it uses to
rotate around the environment. The middle mouse button will also move
the camera depending on where the cursor is on the screen.

| Middle Mouse Click                   | Sets pivot point for rotating around the world |
| Middle Mouse + Middle Region         | Move camera parallel to ground                 |
| Shift + Middle Mouse + Middle Region | Move camera vertically                         |
| Middle Mouse + Edge Region           | Rotate camera around pivot point               |

| Shift + Middle Mouse + Edge Region   | Changes pitch of the camera                    |

The left mouse button is now used to select and manipulate objects in
the environment. Once an object is selected, it may be moved and
rotated.
